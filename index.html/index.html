<h1>Week 2</h1>
<p>An eye-catching orange emoticon drew my attention initially on the website due to it being contrasted on a grey background. The flashing and changing faces also caught my eye .</p> 
<p> After opening the website, I began to play the game with the keypads. Pressing on the button it told me to, I paid attention to the flashing icons on the small, wide screen. I then pressed the buttons on the keypad in chronological order in which it showed. After playing the game for a couple of tries, I got curious on the rest of the page, scrolling down the up. I pressed on the power button which switched the game off and made it dark.</p>

<p> I spent the most time playing the memory game within the experience that consisted of the keypad, since that was the most entertaining for me. </p>

    <p>  The resemblance allows for easier navigation since the power button is familiar to all technology users and the memory game also involves sound to differentiate the buttons to the user when playing the game.
     
     <p>he familiarity of the Downstream game allows easy interaction with the viewers. Old games can evoke a sense of nostalgia to website users, allowing them to enjoy their experience when engaging with the website.
    
    <p>The most challenging aspect of the Downstream site was the current playtest showing inactive, since the red text seemed like an issue with the site and was disappointing.
    <p> The most satisfying part of the site was the power button, since when it was interacted with, the screen would become dark and the lights would dim from the screen. It was as if the site was a game in itself switched off which was en
