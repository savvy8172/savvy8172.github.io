   <h1>Week 2</h1> 

<p>An eye-catching orange emoticon drew my attention initially on the website due to it being contrasted on a grey background. The flashing and changing faces also caught my eye .</p> 
<p> After opening the website, I began to play the game with the keypads. Pressing on the button it told me to, I paid attention to the flashing icons on the small, wide screen. I then pressed the buttons on the keypad in chronological order in which it showed. After playing the game for a couple of tries, I got curious on the rest of the page, scrolling down the up. I pressed on the power button which switched the game off and made it dark.</p>

<p> I spent the most time playing the memory game within the experience that consisted of the keypad, since that was the most entertaining for me. </p>
<p> The most common action through my interaction experience consisted of me clicking on my trackpad to pick the correct keypad button.</p>
<p> The main objective of the Downstream interactive website is to promote the upcoming simulation game, and get people excited for the Autonomous World. The changing images displayed on the website preview the game, while also providing a memory minigame on the site to give users something to play when checking on the games release</p>
<p>The primary goal is communicated through the product images which you can interact with, the signup flashing text, and the information button in the top right corner of the webpage.</p>
<p>Encouraging ongoing engagement within the website, the minigame is implemented. Therefore whoever is on the site to get an update on the game's status, can be short term entertained. </p>
<p>Downstream is not majorly using mechanisms to draw site users back to their site as it is mostly used to display the games progress and sign you up to a waitlist to be updated.</p>
